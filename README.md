# EER
Equal Error Rate (EER) Plugin for Weka

## Package which provides a way to calculate EER from ROC Curve in Weka.

I replaced [Description.props](https://github.com/eibe/eer/blob/master/Description.props), [EER.jar](https://github.com/eibe/eer/blob/master/EER.jar), [PluginManager.props](https://github.com/eibe/eer/blob/master/PluginManager.props), in the original [ERR.zip](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eer/), then it works!

Download this released zip file and directly use in WEKA package manager.
